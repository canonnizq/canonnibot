CanonNiBot is, shockingly, a bot operated by CanonNi on Wikimedia wikis. This repo contains its source code, written in Rust and run on Toolforge. The .config directory is not tracked by Git due to it containing API keys and nuclear passcodes.

As GitHub isn't exactly a site I frequent, please direct any and all bug reports, suggestions, and whatever else to [my talk page](https://en.wikipedia.org/User_talk:CanonNi). I promise I won't bite... maybe.
